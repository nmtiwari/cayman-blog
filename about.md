Recently graduated from [Iowa State university](http://www.iastate.edu/) and have joined [SAP](https://www.sap.com/corporate/en.html) as software engineer in the mobility devision and am working on developing SDK for application building.

Before that, I took two internships, first at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com) where I helped developing cloud based XBRL documents,
 and second at [Huawei Labs](http://www.huawei.com/us/) where I developed automatic task merge support for compiling the domain specific
programs into multiple performance variants.

Before joining the Masters program I was working as software engineer for [Samsung Research Labs](https://samsung.com/about) where I got opportunities to develop major mobile products including [Galaxy smart phone series](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/)
  and [Rugby 4](http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/all-other-phones/samsung-rugby-4-at-t-flip-phone-sm-b780azkaatt/)


A few things Iâ€™ve built:

  * **[Candoia](http://candoia.org)** Candoia is a platform for realizing Mining Software Repository (MSR) Tools, and more broadly software engineering (SE) tools. Candoia is to these tools as Android and iOS are to mobile applications, and Atom is to text editors
  * **[gradle aspectj](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/aspectj.gradle)**: A gradle plugin for compile time weaving of aspects of aspectj.
  * **[Boa](https://github.com/boalang/compiler)**: I contributed to Boa, a domain-specific language and infrastructure that eases mining software repositories. Boa's infrastructure leverages distributed computing techniques to execute queries against hundreds of thousands of software projects very efficiently.
  * **[Candoia Apps](https://github.com/candoia)** More than dozen diverse Candoia applications focused to perform multiple software engineering tasks.
